- WordPress 5.6+
- WooCommerce 5.0+
- PHP 7.4+

---

## üöÄ How It Works
- On activation, a **daily cron event** is scheduled.
- Every day, the plugin:
  - Searches for **published products** older than your configured time period.
  - Deletes products that are marked as **out of stock**.
  - Optionally deletes the product's **featured image** and **gallery images** (while preserving WooCommerce placeholder images).
  - Permanently deletes the product from the database.
  - Tracks deleted product URLs to return a **410 Gone status** when accessed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Navigate to **WooCommerce ‚Üí Delete Old Products** to configure:

- **Product Age (months)**: Products older than this will be considered for deletion (if out of stock).
- **Delete Product Images**: Choose whether to delete product images or keep them when deleting products.
- **Enable 410 Gone Status**: Choose whether to track deleted products and return a 410 Gone HTTP status when their URLs are accessed.

The settings page also shows helpful statistics:
- Total number of products in your store
- Number of out-of-stock products
- Number of products older than your configured threshold
- Number of products eligible for deletion (both out of stock AND old)
- Number of tracked deleted products (when 410 feature is enabled)

You can also trigger a manual cleanup by clicking the "Run Product Cleanup Now" button at the bottom of the settings page.

## üì± SEO Benefits of 410 Gone Status
When a product is deleted, the plugin (if enabled) will:
1. Track the product's URL
2. Return a proper **410 Gone** status code when someone tries to access the deleted product URL
3. Display a user-friendly message indicating the product is no longer available
4. Provide navigation back to the shop

This is better for SEO than a standard 404 page because:
- It tells search engines the product has been **intentionally removed** (not just missing)
- Search engines will remove the URL from their index faster
- It reduces "crawl budget" waste on pages that no longer exist
- It provides a better user experience for visitors following old links

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Works only if **WooCommerce is active**.
- Only deletes products that are **both out of stock AND older than the configured age**.
- WooCommerce placeholder images are **protected from deletion**.
- Images used in multiple products or in post content are **preserved**.
- Uses **memory-efficient batch processing** to handle large stores.
- The 410 tracking system automatically cleans up records older than 1 year.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling
When the plugin is uninstalled:
- The cron job is unscheduled.
